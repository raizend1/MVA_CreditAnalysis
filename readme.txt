Dear Mr./Ms.


Thank you for your interests in
the data set.
This research employed a binary variable, default
payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. This study reviewed the
literature and used the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:


X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar):
it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary)
credit.


X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).


X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 =
university; 3 = high school; 0, 4, 5, 6 = others).


X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single;
3 = divorce; 0=others).


X5: Age (year).


X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked
the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6
= the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August,
2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale
for the repayment status is: 


-2: No consumption; -1: Paid in full; 0: The
use of revolving credit; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for
two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for
nine months and above.

Note:Is it interesting to get which one of each category has?

Note:Un cr?dito revolvente o cr?dito revolving (del ingl?s revolving credit) es un 
tipo de cr?dito que no tiene un n?mero fijo de cuotas, en contraste con el cr?dito convencional. Ejemplos de cr?ditos revolventes son los asociados a las tarjetas de cr?dito.


X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT
dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of
bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April,
2005. 

X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT
dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August,
2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.
